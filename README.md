# EEG Motor Imagery Classification in Node.js with BCI.jsÂ Tutorial Code

This is the code which accompanies the motor imagery tutorial I wrote.

## Getting Started

From the root of this directory, run

```bash
npm install
```

Then for classification results allowing unknown values, run

```bash
node ./classifyImagery-unknowns.js
```

For classification results which don't allow unknown values, run

```bash
node ./classifyImagery-noUnknowns.js
```
